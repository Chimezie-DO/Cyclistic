## Business Context
Cyclistic is a bike-share company aiming to increase annual memberships. While casual riders generate short-term revenue, annual members provide more stable and predictable income. This analysis examines behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members to support data-driven marketing decisions.

## Business Question
How can Cyclistic convert casual riders into annual members based on observed usage patterns?

## Data
The analysis uses historical bike-trip data from Q1 2019 and Q1 2020. The dataset includes trip-level information such as ride duration, timestamps, station locations, and rider type. Raw data files are excluded from this repository due to size constraints.

## Analysis
rides_clean %>%
  group_by(user_type) %>%
  summarise(avg_ride_length = mean(ride_length))
Casual riders exhibit significantly longer average ride durations than annual members, suggesting a more leisure-oriented usage pattern.

## Key Insights
- Casual riders take longer rides on average, indicating leisure-focused usage.
- Casual rider activity peaks on weekends.
- Annual members ride more frequently on weekdays, consistent with commuting behavior.

## Recommendations
- Introduce weekend-focused membership promotions targeting casual riders.
- Offer short-term or trial membership options tailored to leisure users.
- Concentrate marketing efforts during weekends when casual rider engagement is highest.

## Limitations
- The analysis is limited to Q1 data and may not capture seasonal riding behavior.
- External factors such as weather and special events were not considered.
